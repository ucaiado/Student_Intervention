Build a Student Intervention System
--------------------------


This project is part of the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) program, from Udacity. You can check my report <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/18r3oqt706gwmxj/building-student-intervention.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a> and the notebook with most of the codes used in this project <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ucaiado/Student_Intervention/blob/master/student_intervention.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>. I will model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam using concepts from supervised machine learning and will try to minimize the amount of computation resources used to make a reliable prediction. The TEX file was produced with help of [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ynbqmvzddcmt).
