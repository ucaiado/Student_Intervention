Build a Student Intervention System
--------------------------


This project is part of of the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) program, from Udacity. You can check my report <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/89756/articles/103837/_show_article" target="_blank">here</a>. I will model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam using concepts from supervised machine learning and will try to minimize the amount of computation resources used to make a reliable prediction
